### File Encryption and Decryption using AES in C++

This C++ code demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt a file using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, a widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm.

### How it Works

1. **Include Necessary Libraries**:
   - The code includes several libraries required for AES encryption and file handling.

2. **Key and Initialization Vector (IV)**:
   - AES encryption requires a key and an Initialization Vector (IV).
   - In this code, both the key and IV are specified as arrays of bytes. It's important to keep these values secure.

3. **EncryptFile Function
